[DOWNLOAD THE LATEST](
  https://github.com/stargatedaw/stargate-sample-pack/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
)

A properly open source, crowd sourced, free, royalty-free, attribution-free
sample pack, optimized for the common use-cases and a relatively small download
size.

[Stargate DAW](https://github.com/stargateaudio/stargate) projects bundle the
samples they use, but nearly all sample packs either do not allow
redistributing samples, or have vague licensing that makes distributing samples
questionable or difficult.  This sample pack aims to create high quality
samples, for free, that can be used by anybody for any purpose, without
restriction.

# Contributing
You can synthesize, record and process samples in Stargate DAW or any
other software, as long as it is not playing samples.  For example, you cannot
render the samples directly out of a proprietary sampler plugin with
proprietary sample libraries.

Guidelines:
- Please trim the excess space from the beginning and end of the samples to
  keep the file size to a minimum.  Once you have a collection of samples,
  create a subfolder in the following format:
- Avoid the use of whitespace in file or folder names, dashes are preferred,
  underscores are also acceptable
- Do not sample from copyrighted songs, TV or any other copyrighted work
- Please keep the quality high, take the extra time to EQ, trim and process
  the samples as many times as needed to get the desired sound.  Considering
  filtering off excessive low and high frequencies if that makes sense on
  the particular sample.
- Github has a file size limit of 100MB, but generally samples should be much
  smaller than this

### Creating the folder structure
```
stargate-sample-pack/your-artist-name/your-sample-pack-name

# containing organized subfolders like
kick-drums/
snares/
claps/
loops/
hihats/
violin/
synth-bass/
bass-guitar/

# You can create a README.md in your artist name and sample pack name folders
# to describe the sample pack, give yourself attribution, promote your
# website or pages
```

Create a pull request from this.  If you do not know how to create a pull
request, you can create an issue tracker and attach the samples as a zip file
 or link to them using a service like Google Drive or wormhole.app.
